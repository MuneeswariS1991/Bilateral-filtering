# Bilateral-filtering
A bilateral filter is a kind of filter that reduces the noise for the smoothening images. Itâ€™s a type of non-linear filter which replaces an image by the nearby average filter of the image. But the weight of pixels is not only depended only Euclidean distance of pixels but also on the radiometric differences. We are going to use this using the OpenCV method in python. A bilateral filter is used for smoothening images and reducing noise, while preserving edges. This article explains an approach using the averaging filter, while this article provides one using a median filter.
